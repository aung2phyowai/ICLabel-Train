# ICLabel Training Files
This repository contains files for training the ICLabel classifier, an electroencephalographic (EEG) independent component (IC) classifier, in Tensorflow. More information about the ICLabel project can found at the [ICLabel website](iclabel.ucsd.edu/tutorial/about) and in the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07915).

### Files
 - tfGAN_indvBN.py: classes for generative adversarial classifiers (GAN)
 - tfMLP.py: classes for multilayer perceptrons (MLP)
 - icl_final_cv_test.py: ten-fold cross validation across six conditions and a final training across all training dataML enhanced for web apps!

Training requires the [ICLabel dataset](https://github.com/lucapton/ICLabel-Dataset).
